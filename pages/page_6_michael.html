	Wishing You the Best Birthday! 
	</h1>
	<br>
	<h2>
	I remember when I first met you in July 2018.<br>
	I was so new and distant, but you were so friendly.<br>
	I originally planned on moving to Vietnam for a month, but<br>
	Once I became your friend, things started getting brighter.<br>
	<br>
	From our lovely Friday morning coffees at Gia Định<br>
	To our amazing nights out in District 1,<br>
	You made my four years in Vietnam so special.<br>
	<br>
	Even though we're not together right now<br>
	I am thinking about you and hope you have an amazing birthday!<br>
	Sorry for the website, this is the best we could do hahaha<br>
	Te extraño mucho!<br>
